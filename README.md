## Usage

After selecting _Find a Group_ in Group Finder > Premade Groups > Arenas, you should see a _Filters_ button to the right of the search field. Clicking this button will reveal a list of checkboxes for classes and roles to be included in the search results. Results shown only include those which contain a member matching at least one of the checked items.

Your filter preferences are saved between sessions, but are unique per character.
